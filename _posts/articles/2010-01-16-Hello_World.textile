"Babalela" is a Silozi word that roughly means "to take *care* of". Care is an essential ingredient for success and by sharing some simple ideas and thoughts, I hope to learn just how essential.

In time, I'd like this space grow in to a kind of caretaker establishment for freelancers and small business owners in Zambia.

Hello, World!
